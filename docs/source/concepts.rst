Key Concepts
============

Let's first recap our example reporting workflow:

- An editor finds a good story and sends a reporter off to investigate.
- The reporter writes up a draft article.
- A more experienced reporter then reviews the article and suggests improvements.
- In parallel with the reporting step, a photographer captures photos for the story.
- A senior photographer reviews the photos and selects the best ones.
- The selected photos are resized and recolored for display across different media.
- Finally, a copy editor adds headlines and photo captions to complete the story.

We'll now walk you through major Orchestra concepts based on the example above.


Workflows
---------
- The entire process above is called a workflow, comprised of five component steps.
- Two of these steps require review, where more experienced experts review the original work performed.
- The photo resizing step is a machine step, completed by automation rather than by experts.
- Each step emits a JSON blob with structured data generated by either humans or machines.
- Steps have access to data emitted by previous steps that they depend on, so the copy editor has access to both the story and the resized photos.


Project Distribution
--------------------
- Projects are a series of interconnected tasks. A project is an instance of a workflow; a task is an instance of a step.

  - An editor with a story about local elections would create an elections project, with tasks for a reporter/photographer/copy editor

- Tasks are carried out by an expert or by a machine.

  - Photographers capture the story
  - Machines resize and recolor the photos

- Experts can come from anywhere, from a company's employees to freelancers off of platforms like Upwork.


Hierarchical Review
-------------------
- Core experts do the initial work on a task.
- Reviewers provide feedback to other experts to make their work even better.
- The core expert submits the task when their work is complete.
- The reviewer can choose to accept the task, which is either selected for further review or marked as complete.
- They could also choose to return the task, requesting changes from and giving feedback to the worker they are reviewing.


Worker Certification
--------------------
- Certifications allow experts to work on tasks they're great at.
- Experts can work toward all sorts of certifications, picking up practice tasks to build experience.

  - Joseph is a solid reporter but needs a little more practice as a photographerâ€”let's give him some simple tasks so he can improve!

- Experts need additional certification to work in a reviewer role.

  - Amy has been reporting for quite some time and would be great at mentoring new reporters.


Life of a Task

Core Expert
~~~~~~~~~~~
A core expert performs initial task work which will later be reviewed. The below diagram shows a task's movement through the core worker's dashboard.

Reviewer

A reviewer evaluates the core expert's work and provides feedback. The below diagram shows a task's movement through a reviewer's dashboard.
